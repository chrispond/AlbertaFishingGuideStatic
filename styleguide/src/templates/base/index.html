          <h1>Alberta Fishing</h1>
          <p>Alberta is host to a modest number of fishing opportunities when compared to our neighbouring provinces, and most other Canadian provinces. Which puts a higher then normal level of pressure on our bodies of water. This requires an extra level of effort to maintain a healthy fish population, which is why it is important to know and follow the rules set by the provincial and federal government at minimum. It would be encouraged to go beyond what the governing bodies have recommended and do your part in maintaining the best conservation practices for the bodies of water you visit.</p>
          <h2>Provincial Fishing</h2>
          <p>Is made up of three main land zones; Northern Boreal, Eastern Slopes &amp; Prairie Parkland which cover most of the province. The provincial government has created rules and regulations for all bodies of water that are within these zones. For the official detailed explanation of the Alberta fishing rules and regulations, download the <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.albertaregulations.ca/fishingregs-pdfs-2020.html">2020/2021 Alberta Guide to Sport Fishing Regulations.</a> </strong>or visit <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.albertaregulations.ca/"><strong>www.albertaregulations.ca</strong></a></p>
          <h2>National Park Fishing</h2>
          <p>Consists of five national parks; Banff, Jasper, Waterton Lakes, Wood Buffalo and Elk Island. Of those five only three offer good opportunity for angling. Elk Island has prohibited fishing throughout the park, and Wood Buffalo has less then ideal angler access and conditions for healthy fish populations; with the exception of the major river systems. Each national park issues their own license, and fishing regulations  which are not transferable between parks. You provincial license is not recognized inside any national park.
